# PRODIGY_DS_01

Task: 

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

I had modified this, and made a new model, with different dataset, since in the end the task is to plot a bar chart or histogram
